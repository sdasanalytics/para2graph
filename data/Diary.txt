Neha messaged in the morning about the passing away of Dr. kaka. Really sad news. Can't do much. Tragic life. May his soul rest in peace
Still taking rest and not joined work, though did log in briefly for ITM and one or 2 other small things
Planning to join back work in full force from Monday
Took the self test again today. It turned out that I am still mildly +ve. It has just been 4 days since the Monday test I took, hence not surprising, but a bit of a bummer none the less. Means, will have to continue to wear masks and stay as isolated as possible
Meanwhile, I have been watching "Shark Tank India". Quite like the program. Lots of things to learn about the Business, Start-up and Enterpreneurship scene in India. Encouraging the kids to watch it too.
